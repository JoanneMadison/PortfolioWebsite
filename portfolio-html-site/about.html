            <h1>Hi, thank you for visiting my website!</h1>
              <p>My name is Madison Maloney and as a Las Vegas native, born and raised, I attended Veterans Tribute Career and Technical Academy (VTCTA) and majored in their Emergency Medical Technician course during high school. While attending VTCTA,  I developed the passion and skill that first responders possess in order to serve and keep their community safe. Although I do want to serve as an EMT during college and perhaps on a volunteer basis as an adult, my career goal has a slightly different twist. Currently, I attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) as a computer science major with double minors in mathematics and psychology. Iâ€™ve always had an adept ability in computer programming, and I desire the knowledge to apply my skills somewhere or somehow within the medical industry.  My ultimate goal is to design new technology and/or software which could be used to aid medical staff to efficiently improve patient care and prognosis. </p>
